However, value investors will care about much more than just this.
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.
III currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.88, while ACN has a forward P/E of 22.83. We also note that III has a PEG ratio of 0.71.

These are just a few of the metrics contributing to III's Value grade of A and ACN's Value grade of D.
