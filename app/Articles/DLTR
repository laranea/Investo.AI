Dollar Tree (DLTR) was once a pioneer in the dollar store and discount retail arenas. The company, founded 30 years ago, has enjoyed significant success in this sector. However, Dollar Tree is not what it once was. In terms of market capitalization, the Dollar Tree business ($23.3B) has fallen behind rivals such as Dollar General (DG) ($29.7B). The mojo that Dollar Tree once had as a pioneer of the discount retail industry has been lost. But fear not, investors. An activist hedge fund by the name of Starboard Value has entered the scene in hopes of reviving the struggling dollar-retailer. Their suggestions could make Dollar Tree a strong buy in an economy that could not be more favorable to dollar-store chains. At a value of $370 million, Starboard Value has just taken a 1.7% stake in Dollar Tree. In a letter to CEO Gary Philbin, Starboard Value stated their faith in the future of the dollar-retailer in saying, “We believe that Dollar Tree is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that are within the control of management…”
Starboard Value, the activist hedge fund, believes in Dollar Tree – but only to a point. In fact, they made their opinion very clear when they characterized Dollar Tree as having “gone from industry leader to industry laggard.” Per Starboard, Dollar Tree has a short list to get back to that industry-leading standing. Among these suggestions, Starboard calls on Dollar Tree to explore strategic alternatives for its Family Dollar business, including a sale. Further, they should switch to a multi-price point strategy at branded stores rather than sticking to the everything-sells-for-one-dollar business model. Finally, Starboard suggested that Dollar Tree revamp its Board of Directors.
