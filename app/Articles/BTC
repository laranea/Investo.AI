Bitcoin has plunged in price in the past year, but the CEO of one of the world’s biggest exchange operators isn’t deterred from entering the space.
Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of IntercontinentalExchange (ticker: ICE) and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, spoke enthusiastically about cryptocurrencies at the Consensus Invest conference in New York on Tuesday. With Bitcoin down more than 80% from its highs, he said he’s been seeing headlines asking “Will digital assets survive?”
We continue to watch with a fascination as the stock market refuses to sell off—the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped just 33.97 points, or 0.1% on Tuesday, what counts for a drop these days.
The Dow has gained nearly 12% in 2019, a pace that would see the index double this year, including reinvested dividends. And as we mentioned yesterday, the S&P 500 has returned more than 16% annualized during the past 10 years, a pace that is well above the 11% annual return since 1950, according to Bloomberg data.
