There are few names more synonymous with oil than Exxon Mobil (XOM). The value of both took a beating in 2018.
With only four trading days left in the year, we thought we’d take a look at all 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, starting with the worst performer— Goldman Sachs Group (GS)—and working our way up to the highest-flying stock in the benchmark, Merck (MRK). The rankings will shift over the next three days, but the stories behind the stocks shouldn’t.
While oil looked like it was on the road to recovery for much of 2018—despite ups and downs throughout—even at the start of the year that wasn’t enough to lift Exxon post-earnings. That meant that at the end of the first quarter, Exxon was still firmly lodged in the red, despite unveiling an ambitious five-year plan and analysts touting brighter days to come for big oil.
Things didn’t get easier for Exxon after that.  The subsequent slump in oil prices, especially in the fourth quarter, meant more pain for the stock (even as one analyst argued that higher oil prices were bad news for Exxon.) By summer, analysts were warning against being too optimistic. New York State also sued the company, alleging that Exxon deceived investors about the risks to its business from climate change regulation.
Although Exxon stock outperformed rival Chevron (CVX) after a Barron’scover story in May through earlier this month, we’ve decided to go with Chevron for 2019, a sentiment echoed by analysts.
