From time to time, you hit a company that is so old that you can’t believe it grows anymore. What would you think of a company selling car parts for nearly 100 years and still showing growth potential today? This is exactly the case of Genuine Parts (GPC). The stock has been put in the penalty box over the past 3 years. While the S&P 500 surged by 35% (as of July 25th), GPC has shown a poor +10% performance since July 2015. However, I’m seeing some rebound recently and it could be great timing to add this steady dividend grower to your portfolio.
Founded in 1929, Genuine Parts (GPC) is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products, and electrical & electronic materials. It has an interesting growth model combining small but recurring acquisitions added to internal growth. However, 75% of its business is still done in the U.S.
