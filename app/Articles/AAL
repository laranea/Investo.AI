American Airlines Group (AAL) has been one of the worst-performing airlines in 2018, but its upcoming third-quarter earnings could be a chance for the legacy carrier to make up some ground.Where we were: Airlines in general have struggled this year, but American has been hit harder than most, falling more than 39% year to date.Where we we’re headed: Investors have cheered results from other legacy carriers—and could bid up American’s stock if it provides an upbeat report.Airlines stocks have been hamstrung for much of 2018 (not that passengers, who seem to face a constant barrage of new fees, would realize it). It’s not the demand part of the equation that’s the problem – plenty of people around the world want to fly more. However, investors were concerned that airlines, eager to capture the growing market, were adding too much capacity too quickly. That undermines pricing power in any industry, but was seen as particularly troubling for airlines, given a historic lack of discipline and rising oil prices.
