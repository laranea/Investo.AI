Rising home prices, combined with the jump in interest rates over the past year, are weighing on demand in the U.S., especially for more expensive properties. On a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer David Auld said the market has been “choppy” in the past four or five weeks. A “little momentum is slipping from the market,” he said.
Higher land, labor and materials costs are cutting into builder profit margins, limiting their ability to raise prices. D.R. Horton’s gross margin of 21.6 percent for the fiscal fourth quarter was down from 21.9 percent in the previous three months as average home construction costs increased more than average selling prices.
D.R. Horton’s focus on lower-end homes positions the company better than competitors in a weakening market. Demand for starter homes remains strong because supplies are tightest in that category. Even though young buyers are more sensitive to higher mortgage rates, the sheer size of the millennial generation will continue to fuel sales growth.
D.R. Horton shares fell as much as 10 percent, the biggest intraday decline since August 2015. They were trading at $35.54, down 5.5 percent, at 12:03 p.m. New York time. It was the worst performance in an S&P index of U.S. homebuilders, which fell 1.9 percent.
