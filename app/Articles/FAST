Shares of Fastenal Company FAST are up roughly 14% over the last three months. But FAST stock has dipped 3% in the last month in a sign that investors might be nervous about the industrial and construction supplies power. So, let's see what we should expect from Fastenal's Q3 financial results to understand if FAST stock might be worth buying before Wednesday.
Overview
Fastenal's second-quarter revenues surged over 13%, driven by industrial vending and Onsite locations. The company signed 5,537 industrial vending devices last quarter, which marked a 13.4% jump. Investors should note that Fastenal's vending business, which is essentially a vending machine for supplies, is expected to be a significant part of its future. 
Meanwhile, the Minnesota-based company's Onsite business grew significantly as well. Similarly, Fastenal's Onsite business is exactly what its name implies. The company offers clients the chance to bring on a Fastenal team and products into their business. The firm signed 19% more Onsite clients last quarter to help Fastenal close the quarter with 761 active sites. This represented a nearly 57% surge from the year-ago period.
