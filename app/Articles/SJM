At the end of July 2016, shares of Ohio-based J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM), known for its classic brands like Jif, Smucker’s, Folgers, Pillsbury and an assortment of pet foods, was trading hands around ~$154. In the four quarters leading up to that point, the company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.79, equating to an earnings multiple of ~20.
That’s not outrageous for a well-established firm consistently pumping out hundreds of millions in profits year after year. However, there are two important observations that we should make about this sort of valuation.
The first is a historical perspective. Over the past couple of decades, shares of J.M. Smucker have traded hands with an average earnings multiple of 16 to 18 times profits, depending on when you start and end your observation period. The range has been down to 10 times earnings or so during the last recession, all the way up to the mid-20s, call it 25.
Now the second observation is what this type of valuation implies. We know that back in 2016 shares traded hands around ~20 times adjusted earnings, on the high end of what has typically been considered “fair.” The implication of this is growth, or more precisely, the expectation of growth to justify the loftier valuation.
J.M. Smucker has been a consistent business for decades now; the quality portion is known. What investors generally guess about, and why you often see wide discrepancies in valuation, is how this quality interacts with future profit growth. That is, the above-average valuation was predicated on growth showing up.
In the past two years, J.M Smucker did not turn in poor results. Against $7.79 in adjusted earnings per share in 2016, it reported $7.72 in adjusted earnings in 2017 and $7.96 in 2018. (Note, the company’s fiscal year end’s April.)
