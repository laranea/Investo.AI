A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar o f earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole. 

On this front, AmerisourceBergen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.9, actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 16.9. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts AmerisourceBergen's current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 16.1) over the past five years.
Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.
out that AmerisourceBergen has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 11.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for AmerisourceBergen's stock in the near term too.
