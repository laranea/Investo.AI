It's been a rough couple of months for creative software publisher Adobe (ADBE), the vendor behind popular applications like PhotoShop and Acrobat. After a rally earlier in the year fueled by investor optimism over the pace of its transition into subscription-oriented revenues, Adobe has fallen back alongside other high-growth technology stocks both on widespread rotation out of the tech sector as well as a concern that Adobe will need to rely on acquisitions like Marketo to produce growth. Adobe remains well off its 2018 high of $280, and the company's quarterly beat in Q4 did little to raise optimism - in fact, shares slid more than 6% on the news.
I've been steadily building a long position in Adobe since last quarter, when shares were beginning their descent from peak values. What I noted then still holds true: Adobe is one of the most promising stocks to hold amid a wider downturn in the tech sector. Though Adobe is a growth stock, with double-digit advances in both revenues and EPS, it's also a remarkably steady performer and a strong cash flow generator.
We have Adobe's new cloud focus to thank for that. In the past, Adobe collected one-time fees on software sales like most software publishers of its time. Now, however, the lion's share of Adobe's revenues are collected on a subscription basis. Many creative professionals who lean on Adobe for their work are more or less forced into its monthly fees. Adobe's tools have little serious competition in the market, so its ability to retain these revenues is solid. And, as evidenced by the company's purchase of marketing automation company Marketo, the company is making a deeper push into enterprise.
