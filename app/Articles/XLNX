Xilinx (XLNX) is an established name in circuitry. Besides superior bottom line and cash flows compared to peers, Xilinx has posted nice sales growth for last two years. In its latest quarter, the firm has posted 13% yoy and projected yearly guidance to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion which represents roughly 10.28% to 14.22% expected growth. Given the firm's recent development on key design wins from data centers, acquisition of DeePhi tech and collaboration with Daimler (OTCPK:DMLRY) to build custom AI inference platform for their future vehicles, the projections look economically feasible. However, both my DCF model and relative value analysis show that Xilinx is overvalued, the market is pricing enormous growth because of the firm's superior financial performance. Based on current situation, I see a 25% upside on Xilinx for a one-year investment horizon, representing a target price of $96.96. But I expect its current price to at least partially converge to its intrinsic value, which according to my model is $67.56, indicating a $10.01 mispricing at the time of writing this article (Xilinx trading at $77.57). As a result, I would recommend hold and suggest that interested investors buy at better levels as suggested by my valuation.
