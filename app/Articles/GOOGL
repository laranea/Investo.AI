Google became one of the world's most valuable companies on the back of its search engine. Today, Google controls roughly 37.1% of the total U.S. digital advertising market, which tops second place Facebook's 20.6%. Last quarter, Google's ad business surged roughly 20% to hit $28.95 billion.
Alphabet's other divisions have also helped boost the company's overall revenues recently. The firm's Pixel smartphones currently compete against Apple AAPL and other smartphone makers. Plus, Google's new Home Hub has gained steam in the larger home assistant market, driven by the rise of Amazon Alexa-supported devices.
In fact, "Google other revenues," which includes the Google Play Store, Google's Cloud offerings, and its hardware business, saw its revenues jump by $1.05 billion, or over 29% to touch $4.64 billion last quarter. Meanwhile, Google's "other bets" segment climbed roughly 25% to $146 million. This business features its self-driving car segment Waymo, among other future-looking divisions.
Despite Google's growth and outsized influence on our digital age, the company's stock price has fallen roughly 6% over the last year, which includes its 8% post-Christmas climb. GOOGL stock also dip 1.33% Friday to $1,064.47 per share. This marks a roughly 18% downturn from its 52-week high of $1,063.59.
