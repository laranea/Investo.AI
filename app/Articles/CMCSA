One of the worries that kept Comcast’s stock range bound over the last year, is many investors are wondering if the company paid too much for Sky. It’s nearly impossible to answer this question until several years down the road. Since Sky operates primarily overseas, some may not be familiar with the company. To say that Sky is diversified is an understatement. The best way to describe Sky is a combination of ESPN, a huge cable network, DirecTV NOW, and more, under one company umbrella.
To get an idea of what Sky’s worth to Comcast might be, it seems to make sense to look at some similar divisions at other companies. If we look at ESPN’s value to Walt Disney(NYSE: DIS), last quarter the Cable Networks division generated $4.1 billion in revenue. If we look at this unit’s revenue as a percentage of Disney’s overall revenue, it represented nearly 29% of the total. Applying the same percentage to Disney’s market cap means this division is worth an assumed $48 billion to investors.
