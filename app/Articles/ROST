Ross Stores (ROST) is selling off. The company's stock price dropped to $80 after almost hitting $105 two weeks ago. This pushes the year-to-date return down to a mere 1.7%. The reason is the general stock market sell-off as well as pressure after the company mentioned a tough retail environment in its previous earnings call. And that's not everything: the consumer sentiment rally over the past few years that guided the stock so well is starting to cool down. Third quarter EPS came in at $0.91 which is exactly in line with expectations. EPS results have failed to beat estimates for the first time since Q1 of 2016 when results came in as expected. Sales totaled $3.55 billion. This is slightly below expectations of $3.56 billion and 7% higher than the $3.33 billion the company generated in Q3 of 2017. Sales also missed estimates for the first time since Q1/2016. Comparable stores sales were up 3%. This is 1 point below 4% comps growth of the prior-year quarter which is quite impressive given the tough comparison. This is generally something retailers are struggling with. 2017 has been a great year and these growth rates are almost impossible to beat.
