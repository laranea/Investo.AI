For the first time in 16 years, Apple (AAPL) pre-released guidance on earnings - and it's not good. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Tim Cook issued lower earnings guidance for the quarter. Revenue was anticipated to be ~$92 billion for the quarter, but new guidance brings this down to ~$84 billion. Nearly all of this is China. Given the company's current financial landscape, I see a potential investment in Apple as a solid bet. However, once you factor in that eventually the trade war will end and the potential of improvement in the Chinese economy, then an investment in Apple means you would be in front of the potential ~$8 billion increase in revenue from China. This makes the stock a strong buy, in my opinion.
The reaction in the markets from the recent news was swift for Apple. Over the past few months, Apple stock had been moving lower and lower. However, on this specific move, the stock moved from ~$175.00 all the way down to ~143.00.Tim Cook outlined four major factors with regards to earnings: timing of iPhone releases, foreign exchange valuations, supply constraints on new product releases and emerging market concerns.
The real issues lay in the later of the four outlined factors: the emerging markets' economic slowdown. This all largely boils down to one place: China. While all four factors are weighing on this quarter's revenue, I wanted to focus almost entirely on the latter part of this, the China factor. However, I will be brief simply because I am looking at a potential investment in Apple as its current revenue stands. The company's revenue from China is diminished, and the numbers newly printed are what a new investor is investing in.
